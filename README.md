# Majority-Element-python
I am trying to use Boyers and Moore's algorithm to find the majority element among a list. I am using a inbuilt function, count; so, if the majority element is greater than half size of the list then it gives output of 1, otherwise 0. You can find more in this link about Boyers and Moore's Algorithm on finding majority
